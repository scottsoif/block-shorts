# ðŸš« Block Shorts

**Block Shorts** is a simple Chrome extension that helps you remove YouTube Shorts from your browsing experience, so you can focus on what really matters: long-form content!

## Features

- ðŸ›‘ **Block YouTube Shorts** from appearing in your feed or search results.
- âœ… **Toggle on/off**: Quickly enable or disable the extension through an easy-to-use popup.
- âš¡ **Fast and lightweight**: The extension runs in the background and removes Shorts as soon as the page loads.
- ðŸ’¾ **Settings are saved**: Your blocking preferences are saved, so you don't have to set it each time.

## How It Works

Block Shorts identifies and hides any YouTube Shorts videos by targeting elements on the YouTube page that contain `/shorts/` in their URL. This way, Shorts wonâ€™t even appear in your feed or search results.
